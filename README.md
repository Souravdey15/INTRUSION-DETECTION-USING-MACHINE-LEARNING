# INTRUSION-DETECTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is used to watch malicious activities over the network. It can sort the unfamiliar records as normal or attack class. First monitoring is done, and then they order the network traffic into malicious class or regular class. It acts as an alarm system that reports when an illegal activity is detected. The exactness of the IDS depends upon detection rate. If the performance is high for the IDS, then the correctness of detection is also high. Some of the intrusion detection systems are marketed with the ability to stop attacks before they are successful. We are even seeing new systems marketed as intrusion detection systems. Intrusion detection systems have existed for a long time. They are used to shield an association from attack. It is a relative concept that tries to identify a hacker when penetration is attempted. Ideally, such a system will only alarm when a successful attack is made. Intrusion detection system is not a perfect solution to all attack types. A good security program or security tools cannot be replaced by an IDS. The genuine users who may try to access the information for their pleasure cannot be identified with the help of IDS. The goals of IDS provide the requirements for the IDS policy.
